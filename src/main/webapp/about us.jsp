<h4>History</h4>

<p>We at BloodConnect live by the motto of saving lives by ensuring every drop of blood contributes towards the right cause of saving lives.
 A mission started by young IITians (Delhi), BloodConnect commenced operations on 1st April 2010 
 as a project under National Service Scheme (NSS) chapter. 
 Soon, the young team lived by the fact that blood cant be manufactured in factories and committed themselves
  towards connecting generous donors to the donees.</p>

<p>They worked around-the-clock towards this cause, and in no time, 
BloodConnect became a full- scale NGO with a mission of solving the problem of blood shortage in India. 
The organization now caters to any requirement pertaining to blood and by uniting people in need of blood to voluntary blood donors.</p>


<h4>Our Activities</h4>

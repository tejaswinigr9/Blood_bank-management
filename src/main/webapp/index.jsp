<p>Blood is the fluid that circulates throughout our body conducting various functions.
 There are times when a person loses excessive blood and needs blood from some external source.
 In such situations, the donation of blood plays an important role.
 It is the noblest cause you can do to help ailing people. 
 Blood Donation is the process wherein blood is drawn from one person and transfused to another person.
 Blood banks usually engage in this collection process and procedures following it.
 World Blood Donor Day is celebrated on 14th June every year.</p><br>


<h3>Why is Blood Donation Important?</h3>
<p>The main reason to donate blood is to save a life so you must never think twice to donate blood.
 It is a sign of humanity. It doesn’t see the caste, creed, and religion of the blood donor.


Furthermore, the organs in our body conduct different functions and these organs need energy and oxygen to function properly. 
The oxygen and the energy are derived from the blood that circulates in our body. 
So when an organ fails to do a specific function then blood is required from an external source.</p><br>


<h3>Blood Group</h3>
<p>There are mainly four types of blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. 
Negative O blood group is the universal donor and AB positive is the universal recipient.</p><br>


<h3>Benefits of Blood Donation</h3>
<p>There are many advantages to donating blood. 
The most important benefit is that you are saving one life.
 The blood donated can be used three times because it is sectioned into various components, which are very useful.
 It revitalizes the poor health condition of a human being. 
 The human body is capable of regenerating blood within a few hours after donation. 
 Doctors recommend donating blood every three months because it helps to excrete waste blood
  in your body and fresh blood is made which keeps you healthier.</p><br>


<h3>The other benefits are:</h3>

<h4>Preserve Cardiovascular Health:</h4>
<p> Reducing iron in the blood cells can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes through blood donation. 
Research says if participants between the age group of 43 and 61 donate blood every six months then they are 
at a lower risk of getting heart attacks and strokes.</p>


<h4>Reduce the Risk of Cancer:</h4>
<p> The risk of cancer such as liver, lung, colon, and throat cancers can be reduced by consistent blood donation. 
This is because the iron stored in the body is maintained at a healthy level.</p>


<h4>Burn Calories:</h4> 
<p>According to the university of the United States of America, you can burn 650 calories approximately
 per donation of one pint of blood.</p>


<h4>Free Blood Analysis: </h4>
<p>Every donor has to go through a physical test to analyze whether they are eligible to donate blood. 
This preliminary health checkup helps in diagnosing our own body like pressure level, hemoglobin, and iron and sugar level.
It is also tested for HIV, hepatitis, and other diseases.</p>


<h4>A Sense of Pride:</h4>
<p>While there are many physical benefits of donating blood, 
the most powerful health benefit is psychological. 
When you know that the blood that you are donating will be used somewhere to save someone’s life,
it gives you a sense of immense pride.</p>


<h4>Blood Bank:</h4>
<p> Blood donation helps the blood banks to stabilize the various groups of blood that can be used to treat patients 
who are in urgent need of blood transfusion and other medical treatments.<p>


<h3>World Blood Donor Day</h3>
<p>Blood Donor day is celebrated on 14th June to create awareness of the universal need for blood 
for health care and also celebrate and thank every individual who donates blood and encourage more people to start donating.</p><br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In today's time, it is very important to spread awareness about the importance of blood donation,
 people should understand the value of life. Each one of us should donate blood.
 It might save anyone's life and so you should value it and motivate other people around you to donate blood.
 Many NGOs work for this. Their main aim is to make people donate blood and let them know that they have done something so valuable.</p>
